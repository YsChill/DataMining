Question 1.

A.

age: 13, 15, 16, 16, 19, 20, 20, 21, 22, 22, 25, 25, 25, 25, 30, 33, 33, 35, 35, 35, 35, 36, 40, 45, 46, 52, 70

Split into bins of 3

Bin 1: 13, 15, 16
Bin 2: 16, 19, 20
Bin 3: 20, 21, 22
Bin 4: 22, 25, 25
Bin 5: 25, 25, 30
Bin 6: 33, 33, 35
Bin 7: 35, 35, 35
Bin 8: 36, 40, 45
Bin 9: 46, 52, 70

Find mean of each bin and replace numbers with the mean

Bin 1: 14.67, 14.67, 14.67
Bin 2: 18.33, 18.33, 18.33
Bin 3: 21.00, 21.00, 21.00
Bin 4: 24.00, 24.00, 24.00
Bin 5: 26.67, 26.67, 26.67
Bin 6: 33.67, 33.67, 33.67
Bin 7: 35.00, 35.00, 35.00
Bin 8: 40.33, 40.33, 40.33
Bin 9: 56.00, 56.00, 56.00

This reduces the impact of outliers and the noise but does have the potential of smoothing over important variations when bins get too large

B.

Q1: 20
Q3: 35

IQR = 35 - 20 = 15

Lower Bound = 20 - 1.5 * 15 = 20 - 22.5 = -2.5
Upper Bound = 35 + 1.5 * 15 = 35 + 22.5 = 57.5

Only Outlier is the number 70

C.

MIN MAX 35

35 - 13 / 70 - 13 = 22 / 57 ~~ 0.386

D.

Sum all number: 791
Mean = 791 / 27 ~~29.3

Standard Deviation

n = 27
mean = 29.3

Take each value and minus the mean and then square it and then add them all together then devide by the amount of number and then take the square root

you get about 12.9

E. 

Z = 35 - 29.3 / 12.9 = 5.7 / 12.9 ~~ 0.44
